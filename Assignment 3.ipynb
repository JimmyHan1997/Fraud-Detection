    "• Safe for Random Forest (scale-invariant but keeps input uniform).\n",

    "2️.Algorithms Used and Justification\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression – chosen as a fast, interpretable baseline model with L2 regularization to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest – selected for its robustness against noise, ability to model non-linear relationships, and built-in feature importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) – used as a non-parametric model to capture local decision boundaries and serve as contrast to the other two approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "All three algorithms address a binary classification task (fraud vs legit) which fits the dataset goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest was expected to perform best given its ensemble structure and resistance to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3️.Performance Measures and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy – general indicator of model correctness but can be misleading on imbalanced data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision – measures how many predicted frauds were actually fraudulent; important for avoiding false alarms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall (Sensitivity) – shows how many true frauds were successfully detected; crucial in fraud detection to reduce missed cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "F1-Score – balances precision and recall and serves as the main metric for model comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROC-AUC – evaluates the model’s ability to distinguish fraudulent from legitimate transactions independent of threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest achieved the highest recall and ROC-AUC, indicating the best balance between sensitivity and specificity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4️.Avoiding Overfitting and Underfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Used a stratified train/test split to maintain the class ratio and ensure fair evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applied regularization (L2) in Logistic Regression to control model complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Restricted max_depth = 10 and n_estimators = 200 in Random Forest to prevent overfitting and ensure stable generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Set class_weight='balanced' in models to address class imbalance without resampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Used feature scaling for LR and KNN to avoid numerical dominance and support convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared training and test performance to confirm no significant variance (i.e., no overfitting detected).\n",
    "\n",
    "5️.Explainable AI (Feature Influence)\n",
    "\n",
    "Applied Random Forest feature importance as a simple XAI method.\n",
    "• Top contributing features were V14, V17, V10, and Amount.\n",
    "• These features showed strong correlation with fraudulent transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Displayed the top 10 features directly in the console output for clarity and transparency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chose this method for simplicity and interpretability instead of complex frameworks like SHAP or LIME."
